# Sproutbound

A frontend-only, locally saved learning game built with Next.js App Router, TypeScript, React, PixiJS, Zustand, Motion, and Tailwind CSS.

## Run

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:3000. `npm run build` creates a static export in `out/`; there are no server APIs, accounts, credentials, or external AI calls.

## Play

1. Create a greenhouse, customize your avatar, and enter.
2. Click clear floor tiles to walk. Furniture and the central garden block movement.
3. Click your back-left study desk, or use **Learn**, to create a demo learning path.
4. Choose Programming, Mathematics, or Languages for a complete five-lesson course. Other topics use an explicitly labeled learning-skills template. Experience, goal, and duration are saved preferences; this prototype does not adapt the authored curriculum.
5. Read a lesson, answer its three questions, and collect 20 energy. Incorrect answers provide explanations and can be retried. Replays do not grant duplicate rewards.
6. Open **Settings → Show demo controls** and complete a lesson as Maya. Two different contributors unlock the Moonlight Flower. The initial 60 energy plus two completions reaches the first garden upgrade.
7. Continue learning or trigger more simulated completions to reach Bloom at 180 energy and Sanctuary at 300.
8. Refresh: avatar, preferences, lessons, contributions, and progression remain in this browser.

## Controls and accessibility

All essential activities have HTML navigation buttons independent of pointer movement. Escape closes panels; dialogs contain keyboard focus. Settings control reward sounds, ambient motion, interface size, and particles. System reduced-motion preferences are respected. Audio uses quiet synthesized chimes after user interaction. No sound files are required.

## Architecture

- `src/components/GameCanvas.tsx`: independent PixiJS scene, layered procedural artwork, depth ordering, hit targets, avatars, movement, particles.
- `src/lib/movement.ts`: 2:1 projection and collision-aware breadth-first shortest-path navigation on a small tile grid.
- `src/lib/art.ts`: original composable SVG character assets shared between previews and world textures.
- `src/components/Learning.tsx`: complete fullscreen learning flow.
- `src/lib/courses.ts`: fifteen authored lessons, 45 multiple-choice questions, and a general demo template.
- `src/store/game.ts`: local persistence, unique reward claims, identity and settings.

The world uses a detailed environment plate edited from the supplied reference, with independent pixel-art desk, garden, companion, and character sprites. The original procedural renderer is retained in `src/components/ProceduralWorld.tsx` as a development reference. Generated assets are stored in `public/assets/`; characters use compatible illustrated silhouettes with runtime palette customization. Classmates and their activities are local simulations; the copied room code does not provide networking.

## Verify

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

Tests cover coordinate conversion, obstacle avoidance, interactive approach points, lesson completeness, reward idempotency, distinct quest contributors, and stage boundaries.

## Cozy study room

Click a study desk or **Learn** to enter the illustrated cabin. **Flashcards** has six subject decks and answer reveal; **My Desk** retains the full lesson journey and energy rewards. **Stats**, **Quests**, and **Settings** are functional. The focus clock starts, pauses, resets, and supports 5/15/25/45-minute sessions. Flashcard review and active focus time update daily chores automatically; repeat reveals do not count twice. Study-room state is stored separately under `sproutbound-study-room` so existing game progression remains intact.

## Greenhouse polish

Classmates start offline, leaving their desks visible and unoccupied. Toggle their simulated presence in **Settings → Show demo controls**. Your avatar can still walk around the greenhouse, and the Sproutling remains present. The telescope, hearth, plant shelf, and entrance offer additional room interactions. The garden gallery previews all four cosmetic stages; progression never locks lessons or study tools.
